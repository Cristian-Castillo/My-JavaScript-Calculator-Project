-----------------
I learned alot about Redux and how to integrate this application with React. The most challenging part was state management and how arrays should not be mutated. This was a growing pain, but I eventually learned that state is best kept when copied with the spread operator!

Key Features learned:
* Eval - js parsing string for math evalulations
* State Management with Redux
* Code Design and Infrastructure
* Conditionals for digit capacity
* overflow-wrap: break-word - vital in keeping digits within a container
* Mastery of Bootsrap 12 Grid System based
* Advance Web Responsiveness Design Features
